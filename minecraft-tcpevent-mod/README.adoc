= Minecraft TCP Events broadcasting mod

This is a simple Minecraft Forge Mod that can emit JSON serialized representations
of events happening in the Minecraft world.

It opens a Netty tcp server and all clients connected to it will receive event updates
as they happen.

== Trying it out
Seeing the mod in action is a simple as

1. In a first terminal, run
+
[source, bash]
```
./gradlew runClient
```
+
2. In a second terminal (and a third, and a fourth, _etc._) run
+
[source, bash]
```
telnet localhost 8080
```

As events happen in the game (for example a block being placed), JSON representations
of events should be displayed in the telnet windows.
